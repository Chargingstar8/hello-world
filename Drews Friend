I hope you are still coding, Drew told me you were focused on html and css.

These are some great resources that could shorten some of your frontend development time.

Mostly all open source, nice templates. You want to focus more on logic as oppose to html and css. I have a bunch of stuff on my github too you could check out.

Anyway best wishes, if you have any questions let me know.
