I hope you are still coding, Drew told me you were focused on html and css.

These are some great resources that could shorten some of your frontend development time.

Mostly all open source, nice templates. You want to focus more on logic as oppose to html and css. I have a bunch of stuff on my github too you could check out.

Anyway best wishes, if you have any questions let me know.

Hi! I have been still reading about html and css. 
I have been crazy busy lately as I have started a second job 
with the promise of some Wordpress work and some other free training.
It is hard for me to develop a roadmap for what I should learn, there 
Are a lot of languages. 
Thank you for sending me the links! I will check them out and your github.
I am still trying to navigate github, though.  

Thank you, again, for offering some help, I will 
Definitely take you up on that. 


Nice, yah wordpress is still popular. It helps with freelancing for existing projects, upwork.com is a good place to find free landing gigs.

I've chosen to focus primarily on python and react. I use django's framework for a content management system, it's a lot to learn and process.

But html and css will come naturally eventually as you navigate other technologies, docker is huge right now. It allows you to deploy much faster,
and you have to consider learning aws for devops as well. I do plan to make some free training content on my web app. GrinderGifts.com/python is like a resume app,
but on grindergifts.com you can see where I've created subscriptions for customers and automatic checkouts with stripe.
I also have a digital ebooks app up for a client, ownourland.com. Software design is madness, just keep your head down and work lol. If you want to pursue it,
no pressure or time tables just expand and know more tomorrow.
